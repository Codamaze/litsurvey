        "abstract": "Abstract: Medical symptom text classification through Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly evolving field that aims to leverage computational techniques to analyse and interpret vast amounts of textual data generated in healthcare settings. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of current methodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions in this domain. We begin by discussing the importance of symptom classification for improving patient outcomes, supporting clinical decisionmaking, and enhancing disease surveillance. We then review traditional machine learning approaches and advanced deep learning models, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Key pre-processing techniques crucial for handling medical jargon and ensuring data privacy are also examined. The paper further explores real-world applications, including clinical decision support systems, disease outbreak detection, and patient monitoring. Despite significant advancements, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory compliance remain. Finally, we identify emerging trends and potential future developments that could drive further innovation in NLP for healthcare. This survey aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and contribute to the field of medical symptom text classification.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made tremendous impact in every aspect of the world. It is being widely used in every field to generate desirable outcomes within stipulated time-frame with efficacy and accuracy. The healthcare industry has been one of the main beneficiaries of Natural Language Processing (NLP) a subfield of the artificial intelligence (AI). This research study deals with the connection between NLP and healthcare with a special emphasis on how it impacts English language training (ELT). Natural Language Processing has definitely made enormous positive impacts in the field of healthcare. The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in healthcare has changed patient care, lowered administrative costs, and enabled medical research by enabling sophisticated text and speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. These developments in NLP technology, particularly in the field of medical English, which is crucial for medical professionals working in global settings, provide important insights and potential applications in ELT. The language and its usage vary in every field in accordance with the situation. Thus, each variety of English language like Business English, Technical English, Aviation English and so on is unique and the right use of those varieties makes communication better and accurate. This paper investigates how learning environments that are customized to the requirements of individual students can be created using natural language processing (NLP).",
